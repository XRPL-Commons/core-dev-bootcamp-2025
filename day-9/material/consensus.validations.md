## Consensus Validations Overview

**Purpose:**  
Consensus Validations is the subsystem responsible for managing the creation, distribution, reception, trust assessment, and tracking of validation messages in the XRPL consensus process. It ensures that only ledgers with sufficient trusted validations are accepted as validated, detects and diagnoses mismatches or byzantine behavior, and supports the Negative UNL mechanism for network reliability.

## Validation Timing Parameters (ValidationParms)

The `ValidationParms` struct defines critical timing parameters that determine when a validation is considered "current," "stale," or "expired." These parameters directly impact consensus safety and liveness.

```cpp
struct ValidationParms
{
    std::chrono::seconds validationCURRENT_WALL = std::chrono::minutes{5};
    std::chrono::seconds validationCURRENT_LOCAL = std::chrono::minutes{3};
    std::chrono::seconds validationCURRENT_EARLY = std::chrono::minutes{3};
    std::chrono::seconds validationSET_EXPIRES = std::chrono::minutes{10};
    std::chrono::seconds validationFRESHNESS = std::chrono::seconds{20};
};
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

- **validationCURRENT_WALL**:  
  The maximum wall-clock time (5 minutes) that a validation is considered "current" relative to the network's global time. Validations older than this are considered stale and ignored for consensus.

- **validationCURRENT_LOCAL**:  
  The maximum local time (3 minutes) that a validation is considered "current" relative to the local node's clock. This helps mitigate local clock skew.

- **validationCURRENT_EARLY**:  
  The earliest time (3 minutes before now) that a validation is accepted. Prevents nodes from submitting validations too far in advance.

- **validationSET_EXPIRES**:  
  The duration (10 minutes) after which a set of validations is considered expired and can be purged from memory.

- **validationFRESHNESS**:  
  The interval (20 seconds) within which a validation is considered "fresh" for scoring and Negative UNL purposes.

**Impact:**  
These parameters are used in the `isCurrent()` function to determine if a validation should be considered for consensus, and in expiring old validations from memory.

## File and Module-Level Overviews

### `Validations.h`

Defines core data structures and logic for managing and tracking validations in the XRPL consensus process. Introduces configuration parameters (`ValidationParms`), a `SeqEnforcer` utility for sequence number rules, and the main `Validations` template class. The class manages current and historical validations, enforces sequence rules, tracks trusted/untrusted validators, and maintains a ledger trie for efficient consensus operations. Thread safety is ensured via mutexes.

### `RCLValidations.h`

Defines classes and interfaces for handling ledger validations in the Ripple Consensus Layer (RCL). Main classes include `RCLValidation` (wraps a single validation), `RCLValidatedLedger` (represents a validated ledger and its ancestry), and `RCLValidationsAdaptor` (adapts the application context for use with the generic `Validations` framework). Also declares the `handleNewValidation` function.

### `STValidation.h` / `STValidation.cpp`

Defines and implements the `STValidation` class, representing a validation message in the XRP Ledger consensus protocol. Encapsulates information about a validation, such as the signing public key, node ID, sign and seen times, and trust status. Provides methods for signature verification, serialization, and field access.

---

## Validation Message Creation and Broadcasting

### `RCLConsensus::Adaptor::validate`

**Functionality:**
- Creates, signs, and broadcasts a validation message for a newly built ledger.
- Ensures the validation time is strictly increasing.
- Only operates if the node is configured as a validator.
- Sets required and optional fields on the validation message, including ledger hash, consensus hash, sequence, flags, and amendment/fee voting fields.
- Serializes the validation and adds it to the hash router for suppression.
- Processes the validation locally via `handleNewValidation`.
- Broadcasts the validation to peers and publishes it to local subscribers.

---

## Validation Message Handling and Trust Management

### `handleNewValidation`

**Functionality:**
- Processes a new validation message (`STValidation`) received by the server.
- Extracts the signer's public key, ledger hash, and sequence number.
- Looks up the master key for the signing key in the trusted validator list.
- If the validation is not already trusted and the master key is found, marks the validation as trusted.
- Adds the validation to the `Validations` set, receiving a status (`ValStatus`).
- If the validation is "current" and from a trusted validator, calls `LedgerMaster::checkAccept` to check if the ledger should be accepted as validated.
- If the validation is not "current" (stale, badSeq, multiple, or conflicting), logs byzantine or misbehavior, including conflicting or multiple validations from the same validator.

---

## Validation Tracking and Data Structures

### `Validations` Template Class

**Functionality:**
- Manages current and historical validations, enforces validation sequence rules, tracks trusted/untrusted validators, and maintains a ledger trie for efficient consensus operations.
- Data structures:
  - `current_`: Map of nodeID to latest validation.
  - `byLedger_`: Aged unordered map of ledger ID to (nodeID, validation) pairs.
  - `bySequence_`: Aged unordered map of sequence number to (nodeID, validation) pairs.
  - `SeqEnforcer`: Enforces sequence number rules per node.
- Thread safety is ensured via mutexes.

### `SeqEnforcer`

- Ensures that a node cannot submit validations with regressed or duplicate sequence numbers.
- If a sequence is not valid (e.g., too old, duplicate, or regressed), the validation is rejected with `ValStatus::badSeq`.

### Trusted Validation Queries

- `Validations::currentTrusted`: Returns a vector of all current, trusted, and full validations.
- `Validations::getTrustedForLedger`: Returns a vector of trusted, full validations for a specific ledger and sequence number.

---

## Enums and Flags

### `ValStatus` (Validation Status Codes)

```cpp
enum class ValStatus {
    current,      // Validation is accepted and current.
    stale,        // Validation is too old or not timely.
    badSeq,       // Sequence number is invalid for this node.
    multiple,     // Node submitted multiple validations for the same ledger/sequence.
    conflicting   // Node submitted conflicting validations for the same sequence.
};
```
**Usage:**  
Returned by the `add()` method in `Validations` to indicate the result of adding a validation.

### `BypassAccept`

```cpp
enum class BypassAccept : bool { no = false, yes };
```
**Usage:**  
Indicates whether to bypass certain acceptance checks when processing a validation (e.g., for testing or special operational modes).

### Validation Flags

- `vfFullValidation`: Indicates that the validation is a full validation (not a partial/proposal).
- `vfFullyCanonicalSig`: Indicates that the signature is fully canonical.

---

## Thread Safety and Concurrency

- All shared data structures in `Validations` (such as `current_`, `byLedger_`, `bySequence_`) are protected by mutexes.
- All public methods that modify or access shared state acquire the appropriate lock.
- Iteration over validation sets is performed under lock to avoid race conditions.
- The `isValid()` method in `STValidation` caches its result, so repeated calls are safe and efficient.
- The `ValidatorList` and related classes also use mutexes or shared locks for thread safety.

---

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Non-current Validations:**  
  Validations outside the `validationCURRENT_WALL` or `validationCURRENT_LOCAL` windows are ignored and not counted in consensus.

- **Sequence Enforcement Failures:**  
  If a validator submits validations with non-increasing sequence numbers, the newer validation is ignored, and the validator may be flagged as misbehaving.

- **Conflicting/Multiple Validations:**  
  If a validator submits multiple validations for the same ledger sequence but with different hashes, only the first is accepted; subsequent conflicting validations are logged as byzantine behavior.

- **Exceptions and Assertions:**  
  - `isValid()` in `STValidation` asserts that the key type is `secp256k1` and may trigger an assertion failure if the key type is invalid.
  - Other methods may use `XRPL_ASSERT` to enforce invariants; violations indicate programming errors or data corruption.

- **Error Logging:**  
  All byzantine or misbehavior cases are logged, including the raw serialized validation for forensic analysis.

---

## Inter-Module Relationships

- **Validations:**  
  Central repository for all received validations. Manages timing, status, and scoring.

- **RCLValidationsAdaptor:**  
  Adapts the generic validation logic to the specifics of the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL), including ledger structure and transaction sets.

- **LedgerTrie:**  
  Used to organize and traverse the set of validated ledgers, supporting efficient lookup and ancestry queries.

- **LedgerMaster:**  
  Coordinates the current ledger state, tracks the validated ledger, and interacts with the validation module to determine consensus.

- **ValidatorList:**  
  Maintains the list of trusted validators, their public keys, and associated metadata. Used to filter and score incoming validations.

**Consensus Process Flow:**
1. Validators submit signed validations.
2. `Validations` module receives and verifies them.
3. `LedgerTrie` organizes the validated ledgers.
4. `LedgerMaster` uses the results to advance the ledger.
5. `ValidatorList` scores and tracks validator participation.
