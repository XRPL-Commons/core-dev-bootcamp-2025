## Consensus_TXOrdering Overview

Consensus_TXOrdering in XRPL is the process by which the network deterministically orders transactions for inclusion in a ledger during consensus. This ordering is critical for ensuring all nodes apply transactions in the same order, preventing double-spending, and achieving deterministic ledger state. The process involves:

- Collecting candidate transactions from the open ledger.
- Canonically ordering them using a salted, deterministic scheme.
- Proposing and comparing transaction sets among peers.
- Managing disputes over transaction inclusion.
- Reaching consensus on the final ordered set to apply to the ledger.

## Canonical Transaction Ordering

### CanonicalTXSet: Full Sort Key, Tie-Breaking, and Updates

The `CanonicalTXSet` class is central to transaction ordering. It maintains a set of transactions in a deterministic, canonical order for processing in the XRPL ledger.

**Ordering (Full Sort Key):**
Transactions are ordered using a composite key with the following precedence ([src/xrpld/app/misc/CanonicalTXSet.h], [src/xrpld/app/misc/CanonicalTXSet.cpp]):

1. **Salted Account Key (`uint256`)**: The account ID is XORed with a random salt to prevent manipulation of ordering by account selection.
2. **Sequence Proxy (`SeqProxy`)**: Orders transactions from the same account by their sequence number or ticket.
3. **Transaction ID (`uint256`)**: Used as a final tie-breaker to ensure deterministic ordering.

**Tie-Breaking:**
- If two transactions have the same salted account key and sequence proxy, the transaction with the lower (lexicographically) transaction ID is ordered first.
- The operator< for the Key class enforces this order.

**Set Updates:**
- When a transaction is inserted, it is placed according to the sort key.
- If a transaction with the same account and sequence already exists, the new transaction replaces the old one only if it is a valid replacement (e.g., higher fee, as enforced elsewhere).
- When a transaction is removed (e.g., after being applied to a ledger), the set is re-evaluated so that the next valid transaction for each account is promoted.
- The set can be reset with a new salt value to prevent ordering manipulation.

**Example:**
```cpp
void CanonicalTXSet::insert(std::shared_ptr<STTx const> const& txn)
{
    map_.insert(std::make_pair(
        Key(accountKey(txn->getAccountID(sfAccount)),
            txn->getSeqProxy(),
            txn->getTransactionID()),
        txn));
}
```
The `accountKey` function applies a salt to the account ID:
```cpp
uint256 CanonicalTXSet::accountKey(AccountID const& account)
{
    uint256 ret = beast::zero;
    memcpy(ret.begin(), account.begin(), account.size());
    ret ^= salt_;
    return ret;
}
```

## Transaction Set Construction and Proposal

### RCLConsensus::Adaptor::onClose

- Prepares the initial transaction set and proposal for the next consensus round.
- Gathers open transactions, applies canonical ordering, and finalizes the set for proposal.
- See [src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.cpp] for details.

---

## Consensus Process and Dispute Management

### DisputedTx Lifecycle: Creation, Voting, Stalling, and Consensus Impact

**Creation:**
- A `DisputedTx` is created when a transaction is present in one peer's transaction set but not another's during consensus comparison ([src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h]).
- The constructor takes the transaction, the local node's initial vote, the number of peers, and a logging journal ([src/xrpld/consensus/DisputedTx.h]).

**Vote Tracking:**
- Each peer's vote (yes/no) is tracked in a map keyed by peer NodeID.
- The local node's vote is stored separately.
- The class maintains counts of "yays" and "nays" for efficient threshold checks.

**Vote Updates:**
- As new proposals or transaction sets are received, votes are updated via `setVote`.
- If a peer changes their vote, the counts are adjusted.
- The local node may change its vote using `updateVote`, which considers peer votes, consensus parameters, and the Avalanche state machine.

**Stalling:**
- A dispute is considered "stalled" if votes have not changed for a configured number of consensus rounds (`peerUnchangedCounter_`), as determined by `DisputedTx::stalled` ([src/xrpld/consensus/DisputedTx.h]).
- Stalling indicates that further progress on this transaction is unlikely without new proposals or network events.

**Consensus Impact:**
- If the number of "yays" crosses the acceptance threshold, the transaction is included in the consensus set.
- If "nays" cross the rejection threshold, the transaction is dropped.
- Stalled disputes can prevent consensus from progressing and may trigger fallback or timeout logic.

**Lifecycle Summary:**
1. Created when a difference is found between local and peer sets.
2. Votes are tracked and updated as proposals arrive.
3. If votes stabilize (stalled), consensus may be delayed or fallback logic triggered.
4. Once consensus is reached (enough yays or nays), the dispute is resolved.

## Consensus State Determination

### checkConsensus: Parameters, Thresholds, Timeouts, and Return States

**Function:** `ConsensusState checkConsensus(...)` ([src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h], [src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.cpp])

**Input Parameters:**
- `prevProposers`: Number of proposers in the previous round.
- `currentProposers`: Number of proposers in the current round.
- `currentAgree`: Number of agreeing proposers in the current round.
- `currentFinished`: Number of proposers that have finished.
- `previousAgreeTime`: Duration of previous consensus round.
- `currentAgreeTime`: Duration of current consensus round.
- `stalled`: Whether consensus is stalled (e.g., all disputes are stalled).
- `ConsensusParms const& parms`: Consensus configuration parameters.
- `proposing`: Whether the local node is proposing.
- `beast::Journal j`: Logging.
- `clog`: Optional logging stream.

**Thresholds:**
- Acceptance and rejection thresholds are defined in `ConsensusParms` (e.g., `minCONSENSUS_PCT`).
- The Avalanche state machine (see `ConsensusParms::AvalancheState`) adjusts thresholds over time.

**Timeouts:**
- `ledgerMIN_CONSENSUS`: Minimum time before consensus can be reached.
- `ledgerMAX_CONSENSUS`: Maximum time to wait for consensus before considering it failed.
- `ledgerABANDON_CONSENSUS`: Absolute maximum time before abandoning consensus.

**Stalls:**
- If all disputes are stalled (no vote changes for a configured number of rounds), consensus may be considered stalled.
- Stalling can trigger fallback logic or cause consensus to be declared as failed/expired.

**Return States (enum ConsensusState):**
- `No`: Consensus not yet reached.
- `Yes`: Consensus reached (sufficient agreement).
- `MovedOn`: Most nodes have moved on without consensus.
- `Expired`: Consensus round has taken too long and is expired.

**Logic Summary:**
- If not enough time has passed or not enough proposers, returns `No`.
- If sufficient agreement, returns `Yes`.
- If most nodes have moved on, returns `MovedOn`.
- If consensus round has taken too long, returns `Expired`.
- Otherwise, returns `No`.

## Ledger Application and Transaction Queue

### TxQ Ordering: OrderCandidates, Per-Account Logic, and Canonical Set Interaction

**OrderCandidates Comparator ([src/xrpld/app/misc/TxQ.h]):**
```cpp
bool operator()(MaybeTx const& lhs, MaybeTx const& rhs) const {
    if (lhs.feeLevel == rhs.feeLevel)
        return (lhs.txID ^ MaybeTx::parentHashComp) < (rhs.txID ^ MaybeTx::parentHashComp);
    return lhs.feeLevel > rhs.feeLevel;
}
```
- **Fee Level**: Higher fee level transactions are prioritized.
- **TxID XOR Parent Hash**: Used as a tie-breaker for transactions with the same fee, ensuring deterministic ordering.

**Per-Account Logic:**
- Each account can have multiple transactions in the queue, up to `maximumTxnPerAccount` ([src/xrpld/app/misc/TxQ.h]).
- Transactions from the same account must be ordered by sequence number or ticket (enforced by `SeqProxy`).
- If a transaction is blocked (e.g., missing a prior sequence), it is held until the blocker is resolved.

**Canonical Set / TxQ Interaction:**
- When building the CanonicalTXSet for consensus, eligible transactions are pulled from the TxQ in canonical order.
- Blocked or ineligible transactions remain in the TxQ until they can be processed.

---

### Blockers, Retries, and Per-Account Limits

**Blockers:**
- A "blocker" is a transaction that prevents subsequent transactions from the same account from being processed (e.g., due to missing sequence or ticket).
- Blocked transactions are held in the TxQ until the blocker is resolved ([src/xrpld/app/misc/detail/TxQ.cpp]).

**Retry Logic:**
- Blocked transactions are retried automatically when their blockers are cleared.
- If a transaction fails due to a temporary condition (e.g., insufficient fee), it may be retried with a higher fee or after a delay.
- Each transaction has a limited number of retries (`retriesAllowed`).

**Per-Account Limits:**
- Each account is limited to a maximum number of transactions in the TxQ (`maximumTxnPerAccount`).
- If the limit is reached, new transactions from that account are rejected or dropped until space is available.

**Handling Blocked Transactions:**
- Blocked transactions are not included in the CanonicalTXSet until their blockers are resolved.
- If a transaction remains blocked for too long (e.g., due to a missing or invalid prior transaction), it may be dropped from the TxQ according to queue policies.
