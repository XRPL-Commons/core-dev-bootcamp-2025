## Consensus_Peers Overview

Consensus_Peers in XRPL is responsible for managing the set of network peers participating in the consensus process. It handles the reception, validation, and storage of peer proposals, tracks the state and history of each peer, manages disputes over transactions, and coordinates the transition of consensus phases based on peer input. Peer communication is facilitated through the overlay network, ensuring proposals and transaction sets are efficiently relayed and processed.

## Peer Proposal Handling

### RCLConsensus::peerProposal

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.cpp.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  - Entry point for processing a new peer proposal.
  - Acquires a lock on `mutex_` for thread safety.
  - Delegates to `consensus_.peerProposal(now, newProposal)`.

### Consensus<Adaptor>::peerProposal

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  - Logs the incoming proposal.
  - Extracts the peer ID.
  - Updates `recentPeerPositions_` for this peer (deque of up to 10 recent proposals).
  - Calls `peerProposalInternal(now, newPeerPos)` and returns its result.

### Consensus<Adaptor>::peerProposalInternal

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. **Consensus Phase Check:** If `phase_ == ConsensusPhase::accepted`, returns `false`.
  2. **Update Time:** Sets `now_ = now;`
  3. **Extract Proposal and Peer ID.**
  4. **Ledger ID Check:** If `newPeerProp.prevLedger() != prevLedgerID_`, logs and returns `false`.
  5. **Dead Node Check:** If `deadNodes_.find(peerID) != deadNodes_.end()`, logs and returns `false`.
  6. **Proposal Sequence Check:** If the peer already has a position in `currPeerPositions_` and the new proposal's sequence number is not greater, returns `false`.
  7. **Bow Out Handling:** If `newPeerProp.isBowOut()`, logs, removes the peer from `currPeerPositions_`, adds to `deadNodes_`, removes votes from all disputes for this peer, and returns `true`.
  8. **Update/Insert Peer Position:** Updates or inserts the peer's position in `currPeerPositions_`.
  9. **Initial Proposal Handling:** If `newPeerProp.isInitial()`, increments the count for the peer's close time in `rawCloseTimes_.peers`.
  10. **Transaction Set Handling:** If the transaction set referenced by the proposal is not in `acquired_`, attempts to acquire it via `adaptor_.acquireTxSet`. If already acquired and there is a consensus result, updates disputes for this peer.
  11. **Return:** Returns `true` if the proposal was processed.

## Peer State Tracking

### recentPeerPositions_

- **Type:** `hash_map<NodeID_t, std::deque<PeerPosition_t>>`
- **Purpose:** Maintains a rolling history (up to 10) of recent proposals from each peer.
- **Usage:** Updated in `Consensus<Adaptor>::peerProposal` whenever a new proposal is received.

### currPeerPositions_

- **Type:** `hash_map<NodeID_t, PeerPosition_t>`
- **Purpose:** Tracks the current proposal from each peer.
- **Usage:** Updated in `Consensus<Adaptor>::peerProposalInternal` when a new proposal is accepted.

### deadNodes_

- **Type:** `hash_set<NodeID_t>`
- **Purpose:** Tracks peers that have "bowed out" of consensus or are otherwise disqualified.
- **Usage:** Updated in `Consensus<Adaptor>::peerProposalInternal` when a peer bows out.

## Dispute Management

### Consensus<Adaptor>::createDisputes

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Asserts that `result_` is set.
  2. Checks if the transaction set has already been compared; if so, returns.
  3. If the sets are identical, returns.
  4. Compares the local and incoming transaction sets, logging differences.
  5. For each difference:
     - Asserts the difference is valid.
     - Retrieves the transaction from the appropriate set.
     - If a dispute for this transaction already exists, skips.
     - Constructs a new `Dispute_t` (DisputedTx) for the transaction.
     - For each current peer position, updates the peer's vote in the dispute.
     - Shares the disputed transaction with peers.
     - Inserts the dispute into `result_->disputes`.

### DisputedTx

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/DisputedTx.h.txt`
- **Purpose:** Manages the state and voting process for transactions that are disputed during consensus.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `setVote(NodeID_t const& peer, bool votesYes)`: Records or updates a peer's vote, updating `yays_` and `nays_` counters.
  - `unVote(NodeID_t const& peer)`: Removes a peer's vote from the dispute.
  - `updateVote(int percentTime, bool proposing, ConsensusParms const& p)`: Updates the local node's vote based on peer votes and consensus parameters.
  - `stalled(ConsensusParms const& p, bool proposing, int peersUnchanged) const`: Determines if consensus on the transaction has stalled.

### Consensus<Adaptor>::updateDisputes

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Asserts that `result_` is set.
  2. If the transaction set has not been compared, calls `createDisputes`.
  3. For each dispute:
     - Calls `setVote(node, other.exists(d.tx().id()))` to update the peer's vote.
     - If the vote changes, resets `peerUnchangedCounter_` to 0.

## Consensus State Transitions

### Consensus<Adaptor>::haveConsensus

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Asserts that `result_` is set.
  2. Counts how many peers agree/disagree with the local proposal.
  3. Determines if consensus is stalled by checking all disputes.
  4. Calls `checkConsensus` to determine the consensus state.
  5. Handles each consensus state:
     - `No`: Returns false.
     - `Expired`: If not enough rounds have passed, continues; otherwise, logs and calls `leaveConsensus`.
     - `MovedOn`: Logs error.
     - Otherwise: Returns true (consensus reached).

### Consensus<Adaptor>::leaveConsensus

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. If in `proposing` mode and not already bowed out:
     - Marks the position as "bowed out" and shares with the network.
  2. Switches to `observing` mode and logs the action.

### Consensus<Adaptor>::phaseEstablish

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Logs entry into the establish phase and asserts `result_` is set.
  2. Increments counters for unchanged peers and establish rounds.
  3. Updates round timing and proposer count.
  4. Calculates convergence percentage.
  5. Enforces minimum consensus time.
  6. Calls `updateOurPositions`.
  7. Checks if the node should pause or if consensus has been reached.
  8. Checks for close time consensus.
  9. If all conditions are met, finalizes consensus, transitions to `accepted` phase, and notifies the application layer.

### Consensus<Adaptor>::updateOurPositions

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Asserts that `result_` is set and retrieves consensus parameters.
  2. Computes cutoff times for peer and local proposals.
  3. Iterates over current peer positions:
     - Removes stale proposals and their votes from disputes.
     - Tallies close time votes for non-stale proposals.
  4. Updates the local node's transaction set and position if necessary, logs and shares changes, and updates disputes accordingly.

## Peer Communication and Overlay

### RCLConsensus::Adaptor::share

- **Location:** `src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.cpp.txt`
- **Functionality:**
  1. Constructs a `TMProposeSet` protocol message from a peer's proposal, including sequence, close time, transaction hash, previous ledger, public key, and signature.
  2. Relays this proposal to peers using the overlay network:
     - `app_.overlay().relay(prop, peerPos.suppressionID(), peerPos.publicKey());`
  3. The suppression ID is used to prevent duplicate relays of the same proposal.

### Overlay and PeerSet

- **Overlay:** Manages peer connections, message broadcasting, and relaying in the XRPL peer-to-peer network (`src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.h.txt`).
- **PeerSet:** Abstract interface for managing sets of network peers, adding peers, sending protocol messages, and retrieving peer IDs (`src/xrpld/overlay/PeerSet.h.txt`).
- **PeerImp:** Implements the core logic for a peer connection, including message sending/receiving, resource usage, and protocol handling (`src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.h.txt`).

---

## Supporting Data Structures and Utilities

- **ConsensusParms:** Encapsulates configuration parameters for the consensus process, including timeouts, intervals, and consensus thresholds (`src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusParms.h.txt`).
- **ConsensusCloseTimes:** Tracks proposed close times from peers and self (`src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt`).
- **ConsensusResult:** Encapsulates the result of a consensus round, including the transaction set, proposal position, disputes, compared sets, round timing, consensus state, and proposer count (`src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt`).
- **ConsensusMode/ConsensusPhase:** Enumerations for consensus modes (proposing, observing, wrongLedger, switchedLedger) and phases (open, establish, accepted) (`src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt`).
- **RCLCxPeerPos:** Represents a peer's position (proposal) in the consensus process, including public key, signature, suppression ID, and proposal object (`src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLCxPeerPos.h.txt`).
