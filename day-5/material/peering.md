## Overlay Overview

- The XRPL overlay network consists of a collection of peers running `rippled` or compatible software ([README](src/xrpld/overlay/README.md)).
- Each peer maintains multiple outgoing and optional incoming connections to other peers, forming a connected directed graph of nodes (vertices: `rippled` instances, edges: persistent TCP/IP connections).
- The overlay network is layered on top of the public and private Internet, forming an [overlay network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network).
- Each connection is represented by a _Peer_ object. The Overlay manager establishes, receives, and maintains connections to peers. Protocol messages are exchanged between peers and serialized using [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
- The OverlayImpl class manages the peer-to-peer overlay network, handling peer connections, peer discovery, message relaying, and network health monitoring ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)).

---

## Peer Object and Connection Lifecycle

### Peer and PeerImp Classes

- **Peer** ([Peer.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/Peer.h.txt)):
  - Abstract base class representing a network peer.
  - Specifies pure virtual methods for peer communication, transaction queue management, resource charging, feature support, ledger and transaction set queries, and status reporting.
  - Methods include `send`, `getRemoteAddress`, `id`, `cluster`, `getNodePublic`, `json`, `supportsFeature`, and more.

- **PeerImp** ([PeerImp.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.h.txt), [PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
  - Implements the core logic for a peer connection.
  - Manages state, communication, protocol handling, message sending/receiving, resource usage, protocol versioning, compression, transaction and ledger synchronization, and feature negotiation.
  - Tracks peer metrics, manages transaction and ledger queues, and handles protocol-specific messages.
  - Supports features like transaction reduce relay, ledger replay, and squelching.
  - Inherits from Peer and OverlayImpl::Child, and is tightly integrated with the application's overlay and resource management subsystems.

### OverlayImpl Class

- **OverlayImpl** ([OverlayImpl.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.h.txt), [OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)):
  - Main implementation of the Overlay interface.
  - Manages peer connections, message broadcasting and relaying, peer discovery, resource management, and network metrics.
  - Handles the lifecycle of peer objects, tracks network traffic, manages timers and asynchronous operations, and provides JSON-based status and metrics reporting.
  - Supports squelching (rate-limiting) of validators, manages manifests, and integrates with the server handler and resource manager.

---

## Connection Establishment

### Outbound Connection: OverlayImpl::connect

**Function:**  
`void OverlayImpl::connect(beast::IP::Endpoint const& remote_endpoint)`  
([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt))

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Assert operational state:**  
   `XRPL_ASSERT(work_, "ripple::OverlayImpl::connect : work is set");`
2. **Resource management:**  
   - Requests a new outbound resource usage record for the endpoint from the resource manager.
   - If resource limits are exceeded, logs and aborts the connection attempt.
3. **PeerFinder slot allocation:**  
   - Requests a new outbound slot from PeerFinder.
   - If no slot is available, logs and aborts.
4. **Create ConnectAttempt:**  
   - Constructs a `ConnectAttempt` object with application context, IO service, endpoint, resource usage, SSL context, unique connection ID, slot, logging journal, and reference to OverlayImpl.
5. **Register ConnectAttempt:**  
   - Acquires a lock on OverlayImpl's mutex for thread safety.
   - Inserts the ConnectAttempt into the `list_` member, tracking active child objects.
6. **Start connection attempt:**  
   - Calls `run()` on the ConnectAttempt, beginning the asynchronous connection process.

### ConnectAttempt Lifecycle

**ConnectAttempt::run** ([ConnectAttempt.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/ConnectAttempt.cpp.txt)):
- Initiates an asynchronous TCP connection to the remote peer using Boost.Asio.
- Sets up the completion handler (`onConnect`) to be called when the connection attempt completes.
- Ensures thread safety and object lifetime via strand and `shared_from_this()`.

**ConnectAttempt::processResponse** ([ConnectAttempt.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/ConnectAttempt.cpp.txt)):
- Handles the HTTP response from the remote peer.
- If HTTP 503, parses "peer-ips" for alternative addresses and informs PeerFinder.
- Checks for valid peer protocol upgrade.
- Negotiates protocol version.
- Generates shared value for session.
- Verifies handshake and activates peer slot in PeerFinder.
- Constructs a new PeerImp object and adds it to the overlay's active peer list via `overlay_.add_active(peer)`.

### Inbound Connection: OverlayImpl::onHandoff

- Handles incoming connections, performs similar handshake and protocol negotiation as outbound, and constructs PeerImp for the new peer.
- Registers the peer in OverlayImpl's data structures and starts its processing loop.

---

## Handshake and Protocol Negotiation

### HTTP Upgrade and Handshake

([README](src/xrpld/overlay/README.md))
- Outbound peer initiates a TLS connection, then sends an HTTP/1.1 request with URI "/" and uses the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade mechanism with custom headers.
- Both sides verify the provided signature against the session's unique fingerprint.
- If signature check fails, the link is dropped.

### PeerImp::run and doAccept

**PeerImp::run** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- Ensures execution on the correct strand for thread safety.
- Parses handshake headers ("Closed-Ledger", "Previous-Ledger").
- Stores parsed ledger hashes in peer state.
- If inbound, calls `doAccept()`. If outbound, calls `doProtocolStart()`.

**PeerImp::doAccept** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- Asserts read buffer is empty.
- Logs the accept event.
- Generates shared value for session.
- Logs protocol and public key.
- Checks for cluster membership and assigns name if present.
- Calls `overlay_.activate(shared_from_this())` to register the peer as active.
- Prepares and sends handshake response.
- On successful write, calls `doProtocolStart()`.

---

## Peer Activation and Management

### OverlayImpl::add_active and activate

**OverlayImpl::add_active** ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)):
- Acquires mutex lock for thread safety.
- Inserts the peer into:
  - `m_peers` (slot to peer map)
  - `ids_` (ID to peer map)
  - `list_` (pointer to peer map)
- Logs activation.
- Calls `peer->run()` to start the peer's main processing loop.

**OverlayImpl::activate** ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)):
- Inserts the peer into the `ids_` map (ID to peer).
- Logs activation.
- Asserts nonzero peers.

### PeerImp::run and doProtocolStart

**PeerImp::run** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- After handshake, stores ledger hashes and transitions to protocol start.

**PeerImp::doProtocolStart** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- Calls `onReadMessage(error_code(), 0)` to start the asynchronous message receive loop.
- If inbound and supports ValidatorListPropagation, sends validator lists.
- Sends manifests message if available.
- Sets the timer for periodic tasks.

---

## Message Relaying and Squelching

### OverlayImpl::relay

**OverlayImpl::relay(protocol::TMProposeSet& m, uint256 const& uid, PublicKey const& validator)** ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)):
- Calls `app_.getHashRouter().shouldRelay(uid)` to determine if the proposal should be relayed.
- If not, returns an empty set.
- If yes:
  - Creates a shared pointer to a Message object containing the proposal.
  - Iterates over all active peers.
  - For each peer not in the skip set, sends the proposal message.
- Returns the set of peer IDs that were skipped.

### Slot::update and Squelch Mechanism

**Slot::update** ([Slot.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/Slot.h.txt)):
- Tracks peer activity for a validator, incrementing message counts and considering peers for selection.
- When enough peers reach the message threshold, randomly selects a subset to be "Selected" and squelches the rest (temporarily mutes them).
- Squelched peers are unsquelched after expiration.
- Handles all state transitions, logging, and squelch/unsquelch notifications via the SquelchHandler interface.

**OverlayImpl::unsquelch** ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)):
- Looks up the peer by short ID.
- If found, constructs a TMSquelch message with `squelch=false` for the validator.
- Sends the message to the peer, instructing it to stop squelching messages from the validator.

---

## Peer Disconnection and Cleanup

### PeerImp::close

**PeerImp::close** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- Asserts execution on the correct strand.
- If the socket is open:
  - Sets `detaching_` to true.
  - Cancels the peer's timer.
  - Closes the socket.
  - Increments the overlay's peer disconnect counter.
  - Logs the closure at debug or info level, depending on inbound/outbound.

### PeerImp::~PeerImp

**PeerImp::~PeerImp** ([PeerImp.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerImp.cpp.txt)):
- Checks if the peer is a cluster member.
- Calls:
  - `overlay_.deletePeer(id_)` to remove the peer from slot management structures.
  - `overlay_.onPeerDeactivate(id_)` to remove from the active peer ID map.
  - `overlay_.peerFinder().on_closed(slot_)` to inform PeerFinder.
  - `overlay_.remove(slot_)` to remove from slot-to-peer mapping.
- If the peer was a cluster member, logs a warning that it left the cluster.

---

## PeerFinder Integration and Bootstrapping

### Bootstrapping Stages and Connection Preference

PeerFinder manages the process of discovering and connecting to peers in multiple stages, with a defined preference order ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md)):

1. **Fixed Peers**:  
   - Statically configured in the node's configuration file.
   - PeerFinder makes its best effort to connect to all fixed peers before attempting other connections.
   - This ensures the node establishes itself with trusted peers first.

2. **Livecache**:  
   - Contains addresses of peers recently seen as connectible (via Endpoint messages).
   - After fixed peers, PeerFinder attempts connections to Livecache addresses.
   - Livecache addresses are highly likely to be connectible and to have open inbound slots.

3. **Bootcache**:  
   - Persistent cache of endpoint addresses, ranked by locally observed utility (connectibility).
   - Used when fixed and Livecache addresses are exhausted.
   - Bootcache addresses are likely to be connectible, but may not have open slots.

**Connection attempts are made in the order:**  
`Fixed Peers → Livecache → Bootcache`

### Cache Types: Livecache vs. Bootcache

- **Livecache** ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md)):
  - Holds recently relayed IP addresses from Endpoint messages.
  - Entries are ephemeral and represent peers likely to be online and accepting connections.
  - Peers only advertise themselves in the Livecache when they have open inbound slots.
  - Entries are periodically forwarded to neighbors, with hop counts incremented to expand network visibility.

- **Bootcache** ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md)):
  - Persistent, ranked cache of endpoint addresses.
  - Entries are ranked by local observation of connectibility.
  - Used for bootstrapping when other sources are exhausted.
  - Entries may be saturated (no open slots), but are likely to have a well-populated Livecache.

### Slot Types: Fixed, Cluster, and Properties

- **Fixed Slots**:
  - Reserved for connections to fixed peers (from configuration).
  - Always attempted and maintained if possible.
  - Count toward the node's connection limits.

- **Cluster Slots** ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md)):
  - Connections to peers whose public key matches a known cluster public key (configured or learned).
  - **Do not count toward connection limits** (unlimited cluster connections allowed).
  - Used for trusted, closely associated nodes.

- **Other Slot Properties**:
  - Each TCP/IP socket that participates in the overlay occupies a slot.
  - Slot state and type affect connection management and limits.

### Endpoint Message Handling and Address Quality

- When a peer receives an Endpoint message (with hop count zero) from a neighbor, it performs an **incoming connection test** by attempting an outgoing connection to the advertised address ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md)).
- If the test fails, the neighbor is considered firewalled or misconfigured, and its address is not forwarded or stored in caches.
- If the test passes, the address is stored in the cache and forwarded to other peers.
- This mechanism prevents unconnectible addresses from polluting the Livecache and Bootcache.

### PeerFinder Configuration Options

PeerFinder is configured via a `Config` structure ([peerfinder/README.md](src/xrpld/peerfinder/README.md), [PeerfinderConfig.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/peerfinder/detail/PeerfinderConfig.cpp.txt)):

- **autoConnect**:  
  Enables automatic outbound connection attempts using learned addresses.

- **wantIncoming**:  
  Indicates if the node desires inbound connections. If false, the node will not advertise itself in Endpoint messages.

- **maxPeers**:  
  Maximum number of active peer connections (inbound + outbound), excluding fixed and cluster peers.

- **outPeers**:  
  Number of automatic outbound connections to maintain (computed as a percentage of `maxPeers`).

- **listeningPort**:  
  Port number for incoming peer connections.

- **ipLimit**:  
  Maximum number of connections allowed from a single IP address.

- These options are set via configuration files and/or computed defaults.

### Protocol Buffer Wire Compatibility

**Warning:**  
The XRPL overlay protocol uses Google Protocol Buffers for message serialization.  
**Any changes to protocol buffer definitions must maintain wire compatibility.**  
Incompatible changes can break interoperability and partition the network.

---

## Resource Management

([resource/README.md](src/xrpld/resource/README.md))
- ResourceManager tracks resource usage per endpoint and globally.
- Imposes limits to prevent abuse or overload.
- On connection, OverlayImpl consults ResourceManager to determine if a connection should be allowed.
- If over limit, connection is aborted and logged.

---

## Thread Safety

- OverlayImpl and PeerImp use mutexes and Boost.Asio strands to ensure thread safety.
- All modifications to shared state (peer maps, lists) are protected by mutexes.
- Asynchronous operations are serialized via strands.
- PeerImp::close and other critical functions assert execution on the correct strand.

---

## Monitoring Output and JSON Structure

- OverlayImpl provides JSON-based status and metrics reporting ([OverlayImpl.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/OverlayImpl.cpp.txt)).
- The `peers` command returns a JSON object with:
  - **Cluster Information**:  
    - `cluster` object: one entry per cluster member (configured or introduced).
    - Each entry includes:
      - `name` (if available)
      - `age` (seconds since last heard from)
      - `fee` (if reporting an elevated cluster fee)
  - **Peers List**:  
    - `peers` array: one entry per connected peer.
    - Each entry includes:
      - `public_key`
      - `address`
      - `inbound` (if inbound)
      - `cluster` (if cluster member)
      - `uptime` (connection duration)
      - `ip` and `port` (if peer is crawlable)
      - `version` (software version)
      - Additional fields as available.

---

## Testing Requirements

- **All changes to Overlay or PeerFinder must be accompanied by comprehensive tests.**
- Required coverage includes:
  - Bootstrapping logic and connection preference order.
  - Slot management (fixed, cluster, and limits).
  - Address validation and cache population.
  - Configuration option effects.
  - Monitoring output structure and correctness.
  - Protocol buffer compatibility (where applicable).
- Adequate test coverage is required to ensure network stability and prevent regressions.

---

## Supporting Classes and Utilities

- **HashRouter** ([HashRouter.h.txt](src/xrpld/app/misc/HashRouter.h.txt)):
  - Tracks which peers have sent or relayed a given message, prevents redundant processing or relaying, and manages flags indicating the status of each message.
  - Used by OverlayImpl::relay to determine which peers should receive a message.

- **Slot and Slots** ([Slot.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/Slot.h.txt)):
  - Manage peer selection and squelching for reduce relay.
  - Track state of peers (Counting, Selected, Squelched) for a given validator.

- **PeerReservationTable** ([PeerReservationTable.h.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/PeerReservationTable.h.txt)):
  - Manages a set of peer reservations for trusted connections.

- **PeerSet** ([PeerSet.cpp.txt](src/xrpld/overlay/detail/PeerSet.cpp.txt)):
  - Manages sets of peers for ledger and transaction acquisition.
