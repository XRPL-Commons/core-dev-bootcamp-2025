## Transactor Overview

- The `Transactor` class is the base class for all transaction types in the XRPL server ([Transactor.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.h.txt)).
- It encapsulates the logic for applying a transaction to the ledger, including validation, fee deduction, sequence/ticket management, signature and permission checks, and the orchestration of transaction-specific logic via the `doApply()` method.
- All transaction types (e.g., Payment, OfferCreate, EscrowCreate, etc.) inherit from `Transactor` and implement their own `doApply()`.

---

## Transactor Class Architecture

### Core Members and Construction

- **Members** ([Transactor.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.h.txt)):
  - `ApplyContext& ctx_`: The context for transaction application, including the transaction, ledger view, flags, etc.
  - `beast::Journal const j_`: Logging facility.
  - `AccountID const account_`: The account submitting the transaction.
  - `XRPAmount mPriorBalance`: The account's balance before the transaction.
  - `XRPAmount mSourceBalance`: The account's balance after fee deduction.

- **Construction**:
  - The constructor is protected and takes an `ApplyContext&`.
  - Copy and assignment are deleted to enforce correct usage.

### Lifecycle Methods

- **operator()()**: Orchestrates the full transaction lifecycle ([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt)).
- **apply()**: Applies the transaction to the ledger, handling generic steps before delegating to `doApply()`.
- **doApply()**: Pure virtual; implemented by derived classes for transaction-specific logic.
- **preCompute()**: Virtual; can be overridden for pre-application computation.
- **reset()**: Handles fee deduction and state reset in error cases.

---

## Transaction Lifecycle: Orchestration

### Transactor::operator()()

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Logs the transaction application and sets up protocol rule guards.
- (Debug builds) Serializes and deserializes the transaction to check for equivalence.
- If the application is configured to "trap" a specific transaction ID and the current transaction matches, it calls `trapTransaction()`.
- Initializes the result code from the preclaim phase.
- If the transaction is a batch transaction and the batch feature is enabled, it performs special batch transaction checks.
- If the preclaim result is `tesSUCCESS`, it calls `apply()`, which:
  - Prepares the transaction (`preCompute`).
  - Looks up the account's ledger entry.
  - Records prior and source balances.
  - Consumes the sequence number or ticket.
  - Deducts the transaction fee.
  - Updates the account's transaction ID if present.
  - Calls the virtual `doApply()` for transaction-specific logic.
- After application, it checks protocol invariants. If an invariant fails, it attempts to reset and re-check.
- If the transaction was applied, it destroys the fee from the ledger (if not open) and generates transaction metadata.
- If the transaction was a dry run, it marks it as not applied.
- Logs the final result and returns an `ApplyResult` struct with the result code, applied flag, and metadata.

### Invariant Checks and Metadata

- After `apply()`, invariants are checked via `ctx_.checkInvariants(result, fee)`.
- If an invariant fails, `reset(fee)` is called to revert state and re-check invariants.
- If the transaction was applied, `ctx_.destroyXRP(fee)` is called (if not open) and metadata is generated via `ctx_.apply(result)`.

---

## Transaction Application: apply() and doApply()

### Transactor::apply

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Calls `preCompute()` to perform any necessary pre-computation.
- Retrieves the account's ledger entry (`SLE`) via `view().peek(keylet::account(account_))`.
- Asserts that the SLE is not null, unless the account is zero.
- If the account exists:
  - Sets `mPriorBalance` and `mSourceBalance` from the account's balance.
  - Calls `consumeSeqProxy(sle)` to consume the sequence number or ticket.
  - Calls `payFee()` to deduct the transaction fee.
  - If the account has the `sfAccountTxnID` field, updates it with the current transaction's ID.
  - Updates the SLE in the view.
- Calls `doApply()` to perform transaction-specific logic.

#### Full Code (Reconstructed from Context)

TER
Transactor::apply()
{
    preCompute();

    auto const sle = view().peek(keylet::account(account_));
    XRPL_ASSERT( sle != nullptr || account_ == beast::zero, "ripple::Transactor::apply : non-null SLE or zero account");

    if (sle)
    {
        mPriorBalance = STAmount{(*sle)[sfBalance]}.xrp();
        mSourceBalance = mPriorBalance;

        TER result = consumeSeqProxy(sle);
        if (result != tesSUCCESS)
            return result;

        result = payFee();
        if (result != tesSUCCESS)
            return result;

        if (sle->isFieldPresent(sfAccountTxnID))
            sle->setFieldH256(sfAccountTxnID, ctx_.tx.getTransactionID());

        view().update(sle);
    }

    return doApply();
}

### Transactor::doApply

([Transactor.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.h.txt))

- Pure virtual function: `virtual TER doApply() = 0;`
- Implemented by each derived transaction class (e.g., Payment, OfferCreate, EscrowCreate, etc.).
- Responsible for applying the transaction's specific effects to the ledger (e.g., moving funds, creating/modifying ledger objects, updating account state).
- Returns a `TER` code indicating success or the specific reason for failure.

---

## Pre-Application Checks

### Sequence and Ticket Checks

#### Transactor::checkSeqProxy

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Retrieves the account ID from the transaction's `sfAccount` field.
- Looks up the account's ledger entry in the provided ledger view.
- If the account does not exist, logs a message and returns `terNO_ACCOUNT`.
- Retrieves the transaction's sequence proxy (which can be a sequence number or a ticket) and the account's current sequence number (wrapped as a SeqProxy).
- (The rest of the function, not shown, would compare the transaction's sequence/ticket to the account's state and return a NotTEC code indicating whether the transaction's sequence proxy is valid.)

#### Transactor::consumeSeqProxy

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Asserts that the provided account SLE is not null.
- Retrieves the sequence proxy from the transaction context.
- If the sequence proxy is a sequence number:
  - Sets the account's `sfSequence` field to one greater than the current value.
  - Returns `tesSUCCESS`.
- If the sequence proxy is a ticket:
  - Calls `ticketDelete` to remove the ticket from the ledger.
  - Returns the result of `ticketDelete`.

### Prior Transaction and Last Ledger Checks

#### Transactor::checkPriorTxAndLastLedger

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Extracts the AccountID from the transaction's `sfAccount` field.
- Reads the account's ledger entry from the current ledger view.
- If the account does not exist, logs a trace message and returns `terNO_ACCOUNT`.
- If the transaction includes `sfAccountTxnID`, compares it to the account's current `sfAccountTxnID` in the ledger; if they do not match, returns `tefWRONG_PRIOR`.
- If the transaction includes `sfLastLedgerSequence`, checks if the current ledger sequence exceeds it; if so, returns `tefMAX_LEDGER`.
- If all checks pass, returns `tesSUCCESS`.

### Fee Calculation and Validation

#### Transactor::calculateBaseFee

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Retrieves the base fee from the ledger view: `view.fees().base`.
- Counts the number of signers in the transaction (`sfSigners` field).
- Returns `baseFee + (signerCount * baseFee)`.

#### Transactor::minimumFee

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Calls `scaleFeeLoad(baseFee, app.getFeeTrack(), fees, flags & tapUNLIMITED)`.
- Returns the minimum fee required for the transaction, after applying scaling for network load and privilege.

#### Transactor::checkFee

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Checks if the fee is native XRP; if not, returns `temBAD_FEE`.
- Retrieves the fee paid from the transaction.
- For batch transactions, the fee must be zero; otherwise, returns `temBAD_FEE`.
- Checks for legal fee amount (non-negative, legal value).
- If the ledger is open, calculates the minimum required fee and compares; if insufficient, returns `telINSUF_FEE_P`.
- If the fee paid is zero, returns `tesSUCCESS`.
- Determines the paying account (delegate or main account), and checks that it exists.
- Checks the account's balance is sufficient for the fee; if not, returns `tecINSUFF_FEE` or `terINSUF_FEE_B` as appropriate.
- Returns `tesSUCCESS` if all checks pass.

#### Transactor::payFee

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Retrieves the fee paid from the transaction.
- If the ledger is open, calculates the minimum required fee and compares; if insufficient, returns `telINSUF_FEE_P`.
- If the fee paid is zero, returns `tesSUCCESS`.
- Determines the paying account (delegate or main account), and checks that it exists.
- Retrieves the account's balance.
- If the balance is less than the fee, returns `tecINSUFF_FEE` or `terINSUF_FEE_B` as appropriate.
- Returns `tesSUCCESS` if all checks pass.

---

## Signature and Permission Checks

### Transactor::checkSign

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Retrieves the signing public key from the transaction.
- For batch inner transactions, ensures no signatures or signers are present; if present, returns `temINVALID_FLAG`.
- For dry run, if no signature or signers, returns `tesSUCCESS`.
- Determines the account to check (delegate or main account).
- If the transaction contains a `sfSigners` field (multi-signature), calls `checkMultiSign`.
- For single-signature, checks that the signing public key is valid and not empty, and calls `checkSingleSign`.

### Transactor::checkSingleSign

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Static method.
- Verifies the validity of a single-signature on a transaction.
- Checks that the signer is authorized, the signature matches the public key in the ledger entry, and protocol rules are followed.
- Returns a `NotTEC` code indicating success or the specific error encountered.

### Transactor::checkMultiSign

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Static method.
- Verifies the validity of a multi-signature on a transaction.
- Retrieves the account's signer list from the ledger.
- Deserializes the signer list.
- For each signer in the transaction, matches to the account's signer list, validates the signature, and accumulates weights.
- Ensures no duplicates and correct order.
- Checks if the total weight meets or exceeds the required quorum.
- Returns `tesSUCCESS` if all checks pass, or an appropriate error code otherwise.

### Transactor::checkPermission

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Checks if the transaction is permitted, especially for delegated transactions.
- If no delegate, returns `tesSUCCESS`.
- If a delegate is specified, constructs a delegate key and attempts to read the corresponding ledger entry.
- If the delegate ledger entry does not exist, returns `tecNO_DELEGATE_PERMISSION`.
- If the delegate ledger entry exists, calls `checkTxPermission(sle, tx)` to determine if the delegate has the necessary permission.

---

## Fee Deduction and Account State Reset

### Transactor::reset

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Discards any uncommitted changes in the transaction context.
- Fetches the transaction account's ledger entry; if not found, returns `tefINTERNAL`.
- Determines the payer account (delegate or transaction account); if not found, returns `tefINTERNAL`.
- Retrieves the payer's XRP balance.
- Asserts that the balance is valid.
- If the fee exceeds the balance, reduces the fee to the available balance.
- Deducts the fee from the payer's balance.
- Consumes the sequence proxy for the transaction account.
- Updates the ledger state for the affected accounts.
- Returns a pair of the result code and the actual fee charged.

---

## Ticket Deletion

### Transactor::ticketDelete

([Transactor.cpp](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.cpp.txt))

- Retrieves the Ticket ledger entry using its index.
- If not found, logs a fatal error and returns `tefBAD_LEDGER`.
- Removes the ticket from the owner's directory.
- **Issue in provided code:** Attempts to update `sfTicketCount` on the ticket SLE, but this field is on the account root SLE.
- **Correct logic:** Should retrieve the account root SLE, update `sfTicketCount`, decrement the owner count, update the account root SLE, and erase the ticket SLE.
- Erases the ticket SLE from the ledger.
- Returns `tesSUCCESS` if successful.

---

## Extensibility: Derived Transaction Types

- All transaction types inherit from `Transactor` and implement their own `doApply()` ([e.g., CreateOffer.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/CreateOffer.h.txt), [Escrow.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Escrow.h.txt), [PayChan.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/PayChan.h.txt), [AMMCreate.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/AMMCreate.h.txt), [XChainBridge.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/XChainBridge.h.txt), [SetSignerList.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/SetSignerList.h.txt), [DID.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/DID.h.txt), [Credentials.h](src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Credentials.h.txt)).
- Each derived class provides static methods for preflight and preclaim checks, and implements `doApply()` for transaction-specific logic.
- The transaction type is mapped to its handler class via macros in [transactions.macro](include/xrpl/protocol/detail/transactions.macro).
